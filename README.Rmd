`gsdmm` implements short text classification via Dirichlet Mixture Models proposed by [Yin and Wang 2014](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-dirichlet-multinomial-mixture-model-based-for-Yin-Wang/d03ca28403da15e75bc3e90c21eab44031257e80?p2df). It provides a fast `c++` implementation and R interface for the Gibbs sampler described in the paper. Specifically, `gsdmm` implements the Likelihood function allowing for multiple occurrences of the same word in a given text (EQ4).

**Benefits:** \

- very space and time efficient
- unlike LDA it requires only an upper bound on the number of clusters

**Development:** \

- I am planning to add a tuning function for the alpha and beta parameters of the gibbs sampler

## Installation

You can install the development version of gsdmm from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("till-tietz/gsdmm")
```

## Usage

Here is a minimal working example.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# we lemmatize and tokenize creating a list of character vector representing each text
text <- c(
  "Rockets are amazing.",
  "Witnessing a rocket in flight is a marvel of engineering.",
  "We should take a rocket to Mars.",
  "Rocket",
  "Have you ever seen a cat?",
  "Cats are fun.",
  "Your cat seems sweet.",
  "Cat"
) |>
  tolower() |>
  gsub(pattern = "[[:punct:] ]+", replacement = " ") |>
  textstem::lemmatize_strings() |>
  text2vec::word_tokenizer() |>
  lapply(function(i) i[!i %in% stopwords::stopwords()])

set.seed(42)

gsdmm::gsdmm(texts = text, n_iter = 100, n_clust = 20, alpha = 0.1, beta = 0.2, progress = FALSE)
```
